# Edit the variables below so the script can find DROID and Saxon on your system.

DROID="path/to/droid-command-line.jar"
SAXON="path/to/saxon-he.jar"


# For the DROID variable, you need to replace the string between the quotes with the absolute filepath to the saved location of the droid-command-line.jar folder on your computer. This can be found in the top level of the latest DROID release that can be downloaded from the TNA website: https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/.

# i.e. DROID="/mnt/c/Users/username/Desktop/DROID/droid-command-line-6.7.0.jar"


# For the SAXON variable, you need to replace the string between the quotes with the absolute filepath to the saved location of the saxon-he.jar folder on your computer. This can be found in the top level of the latest Saxon Home Edition release that can be downloaded from the Saxonica website: https://www.saxonica.com/download/java.xml

# i.e. SAXON="/mnt/c/Users/username/Desktop/SAXON/saxon-he-12.4.jar"


# If you are using WSL, but have droid or saxon saved on the windows filesystem, you can navigate to it via the /mnt folder on the Ubuntu filesystem.
